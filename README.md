## üìö Projects

Here are some highlights of my projects:

1. [Income_Project]([link_to_project](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Income_project)) -Brief description of the project-Analysis of people's income as per what they do for a living. Trained (ML) models on categoricaldata. Nowadays parents are thinking a lot about their child's future. Achieved accurate prediction of people's income by their work. The system helps encourage parents to make good decisions future of their children.
  
3. [Medical_text_data_project](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Medical_text_data_project) -Brief description of the project -‚Ä¢The objective of this project was to develop a machine-learning model that could predictCancer and symptoms of cancer-based on various features.
The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis,
and feature engineering.
Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM,
were implemented and evaluated using cross-validation.
The final model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set and demonstrated its ability to
predict the survival outcomes.

6. [Mask and NO_mask](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Mask-and-No_mask) - Brief description of the project-Developed a real-time face emoji detection system using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV. Trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify faces as either Mask or No Mask. Achieved accurate
detection of face emoji in live video streams from webcam inputs. Implemented a user-friendly interface
to provide real-time feedback on Face status. The system helps promote Business strategy and safety
measures by identifying individuals' feedback regarding face
