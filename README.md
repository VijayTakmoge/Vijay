## üìö Projects

Here are some highlights of my projects:

1. [Income_Project]([link_to_project](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Income_project)) -Brief description of the project-Analysis of people's income as per what they do for a living. Trained (ML) models on categoricaldata. Nowadays parents are thinking a lot about their child's future. Achieved accurate prediction of people's income by their work. The system helps encourage parents to make good decisions future of their children.
  
3. [Medical_text_data_project](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Medical_text_data_project) -Brief description of the project -‚Ä¢The objective of this project was to develop a machine-learning model that could predictCancer and symptoms of cancer-based on various features.
The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis,
and feature engineering.
Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM, and Bidirectional LSTM,
were implemented and evaluated using cross-validation.
The final model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set and demonstrated its ability to
predict the survival outcomes.

6. [Bank loan prediction](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Bank_loan_prediction) -Brief description of the project This project leverages machine learning to predict loan approvals for banking customers. By implementing a Decision Tree model, the project aims to classify loan eligibility based on customer attributes like income, credit history, and employment status. This model assists financial institutions in making efficient and informed loan approval decisions

7. [Hotel review text data](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Hotel-Review-text-data) Brief description of the project This project leverages NLP and Deep Learning to classify hotel reviews based on customer feedback. Using a dataset of review texts, it enables efficient sentiment analysis and category classification, providing actionable insights. The adaptable system evolves with feedback trends, ensuring scalability and relevance in the hospitality industry.

8. [Employee Analysis](https://github.com/VijayTakmoge/Employee-Analysis-SQL-/tree/main) Brief description of the project Employee Analysis Project using SQL This project focuses on analyzing employee data to extract meaningful insights. Key tasks included identifying high-salary employees, analyzing department sizes, and managing data using SQL operations. The insights supported better workforce planning and organizational growth.
